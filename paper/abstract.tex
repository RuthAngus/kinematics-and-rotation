The rotational evolution of cool dwarfs is mostly unconstrained after around
2-3 billion years, and the gyrochronology relations are poorly calibrated
beyond this time due to a lack of precise ages and rotation periods for old
main-sequence stars.
% However, recent evidence suggests that the relationship between rotation
% period and color/temperature/mass does not remain constant over large
% timescales, contradicting a long-held assumption that underlies many
% gyrochronology relations.
We use the velocities of populations of K dwarfs to reveal the rotational
evolution of these cool stars at old ages.
We find that groups of stars, selected to be the same age using a
gyrochronology relation calibrated to the Praesepe cluster, do {\it not} have
the same velocity dispersion at all temperatures; cooler stars have greater
velocity dispersions than hotter stars.
We interpret this to mean that these cooler stars are older than the hotter
ones, which implies that the period-color relation of Praesepe is not
appropriate for old stars.
Futhermore, our results indicate that the slope of the period-color relation
actually {\it inverts}: at young ages early K stars rotate more rapidly than
late K stars, but beyond $\sim$ 2 Gyr they rotate more slowly.
These observations could be reproduced by mass-dependent dynamical heating,
where lower-mass stars experience a greater rate of dynamical heating than
higher-mass stars, however we find no evidence for mass-dependent heating
within K and M dwarfs in the \kepler\ field.

% We show however, that if mass-dependent heating is responsible, the
% differential heating rate is not constant over logarithmic time intervals
% which implies that different heating processes must be acting before and after
% ages of around 1 Gyr.
% Perhaps a more likely scenario is that the relation between rotation period
% and color changes over time, undergoing a particularly sharp transition at
% around 1 Gyr.
% If we assume that mass-dependent heating does not affect the data,

% (similar to the age of the rotation gap and the 1.1 Gyr NGC 6811
% cluster, shown to have a different period-color relation to Praesepe).
% We find that the ages of field stars with measured rotation periods do not
% exceed 4-6 Gyrs, resolving a long-standing degeneracy between age and magnetic
% braking efficiency.
% We also show that stars rotating just below the rotation period gap are
% dynamically young, ruling out the possibility that the rotation period gap is
% caused by incorrect period measurements or binary companions.
