\section{Conclusion}

We found that old groups of K dwarfs selected to be coeval using the
\citet{angus2019} gyrochronology relation do {\it not} have the same velocity
dispersion across all temperatures.
% This indicates that either the \citep{angus2019} period-color relation is
% incorrect, or that mass-dependent dynamical heating is affecting this data set.
% We presented three pieces of evidence that suggest mass-dependent heating
% cannot be responsible for all of the increasing velocity dispersion.

% \begin{itemize}

% \item{
%         No strong evidence for mass-dependent heating has been found among M, L
% and T-type stars.
% These low-mass stars live longer than the current age of the Universe and
%         therefore do not suffer from a mass-age degeneracy
%         \citep{faherty2009}.
% }

% \item{
%         Literature measurements of the (\vz) AVR exponent are slightly higher
% than the value measured from our data set, but calculated using more massive
% stars.
% Mass-dependent dynamical heating should however produce a {\it smaller} AVR
%         exponent for higher-mass stars.
% We acknowledge that the stars in the \mct\ sample, analyzed in this work, are
%         subject to different selection biases than those used to calculate
%         AVRs in the literature \citep{holmberg2009, aumer2009, yu2018}, so
%         drawing direct comparisons between them does not provide a reliable
%         test.
% }

% \item{
%         The differences in the (\vb) AVR exponent between the hottest and
% coolest K dwarfs in our sample are extremely large, spanning values between
% 0.4 and 0.75, yet the difference in mass is less than a factor of two.
% Such a large spread in AVR exponents cannot be explained by mass-dependent
%         heating alone.
% }

the same age.}

\racomment{Dispersion could be dependent on the selection function.
We cut stars at high b, because we find that these do lead to a bias.
We find no evidence for increased velocity dispersion with decreasing teff in
either vb or vz.
We find that sigma clipping is necessary for vb but not vz and do not find
that the outliers are distributed towards higher galactic latitudes.
