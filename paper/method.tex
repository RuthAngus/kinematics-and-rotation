\subsection{The data}
\label{sec:the_data}

We used the publicly available \kepler-\gaia\ DR2 crossmatched
catalog\footnote{Available at gaia-kepler.fun} to combine the \mct\ catalog of
stellar rotation periods, measured from \kepler\ light curves, with the \gaia\
DR2 catalog of parallaxes, proper motions and apparent magnitudes.
Reddening and extinction from dust was calculated for each star using the
Bayestar dust map implemented in the {\tt dustmaps} {\it Python} package
\citep{green2018}, and {\tt astropy} \citep{astropy2013}.
We estimated effective temperatures from dereddened \Gaia\ \gcolor\ color,
using an 8th-order polynomial relation calibrated using .... stars

% To explore the age of this stellar population from a rotation standpoint, it
% was first necessary to remove visual binaries and subgiants from the sample.
% The rotational evolution of these two types of stars is generally different to
% that of single stars which more usually follow a Skumanich-like spin-down law.
% Tidal and magnetic interactions between the two components of a binary system
% can influence the rotation periods of both stars, and the expanding envelopes
% of subgiants drive rapid spin-down through conservation of angular momentum.
Visual binaries and subgiants were removed from the sample by applying cuts to
the color-magnitude diagram (CMD), shown in figure \ref{fig:age_gradient}.
A 6th-order polynomial was fit to the main sequence and raised by 0.27 dex to
approximate the division between single stars and visual binaries.
All stars above this line were removed from the sample.
Subgiants were also removed by eliminating stars brighter than 6th magnitude
in \gaia\ G-band.

The {\tt Pyia} \citep{price-whelan_2018} and {\tt astropy} \citep{astropy2013,
astropy2018} {\it Python} packages were used to calculate stellar velocities.
{\tt Pyia} calculates velocity samples from the full \gaia\ uncertainty
covariance matrix via Monte Carlo sampling.
It therefore not only incorporates uncertainties on the \gaia\ positions
parallaxes and proper motions, it also accounts for the {\it covariance}
between these properties.
Stars with negative parallaxes, parallax signal-to-noise ratios less than 10,
stars fainter than 16th magnitude, stars with absolute \vb\ uncertainties
greater than 1 \kms\, and stars with galactic latitudes greater than
15\degrees\ were removed from the sample.
Because \vb\ is only a close approximation to \vz\ at low galactic latitudes,
and because latitude is correlated with stellar mass (lower mass stars are
older and tend to be preferentially located at high $b$, although this trends
is greatly reduced for stars cooler than 5000 K), we found that excluding
stars with $b > 15$\degrees\ reduced the number of \vb\ outliers at low
stellar mass.
15\degrees\ was found to be an adequate compromise between maintaining a close
relationship between \vb\ and \vz\ and retaining a sample large enough to
provide meaningful results.
Reducing this cut to 10\degrees\ resulted in a sample size too small to reveal
trends in the data.
% We also found that the anti-correlation between stellar mass and $b$ is
% negligable for stars cooler than 5000 K.
% For this reason, and because the rotational evolution of old, G stars does not
% follow a simple Skumanich-like spin-down law \citep{vansaders2016}, we
% restricted our sample to temperatures between \tmin\ and 5000 K, \ie\ K
% dwarfs.

% black points are dwarf stars identified as non-photometric binaries, hotter

% blue circle points are non-photometric binary dwarfs, cooler than 4800 k, with
% a rotation period and \gaia\ color indicating they are older than 1.1 gyr.
% orange squares are stars that with rotation periods that fall just below the
% gap: they have rotation-ages between 0.5 and 1.1 gyrs.
% green triangles are stars with rotation periods faster than the main envelop
% of stars.
% these are probably binaries whose rotation periods are synchronized to their
% orbits and have been spun-up via tidal interactions.
